## ✨ Hi there, I'm Emma ✨

- 🏫 I am an incoming Computer Science Masters student at McGill and graduate of the Honours Cognitive Science program.
- 🧠 I enjoy learning how brains work, how machines work, how learning works, and how brains and machines can learn and how we can learn about brains and machines. 
- 🎼 I also enjoy music and arts and how tech and CS can expand our creativity in artistic fields. 
- 🌱 I am currently learning full-stack web development. Feel free to check out my personal website!
